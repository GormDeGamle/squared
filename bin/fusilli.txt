Fusilli client Version 1.2.0.2
Built for Windows PC
Usage: fusilli [OPTIONS] ACTION [ACTION OPTIONS]
These actions may be:
       fusilli [OPTIONS] push GAMENAME SCORE [TIMEOUT]
       * submits the score SCORE for the game GAMENAME using the optional
         timeout TIMEOUT (in ms). The default timeout is 10000 ms.
       * OPTIONS may be either --test-me or --cache. In the first case a score
         is only submitted if the score isn't uploaded at c4a yet for the player
         With --cache the score is written to a file if the submit failed
         (e.g. because of a missing network connection). It will be tried
         to be resend the next time a score is submitted with fusilli.
       fusilli emptycache [TIMEOUT]
       * submits the cached scores (if available) using the optional
         timeout TIMEOUT (in ms). The default timeout is 10000 ms.
       fusilli [OPTIONS] pull GAMENAME [TIMEOUT]
       * gets all scores of the game GAMENAME using the optional
         timeout TIMEOUT (in ms). The default timeout is 10000 ms.
       * OPTIONS may be --test-me, --filtered, --MMYYYY, --thismonth or --ranks.
         With --test-me a score is only shown if it is from the owner of the
         profile. With --filtered for every player only the best scores is
         shown. With --MMYYYY you can add a month of a year to show like
         --102014 for the scores of october 2014. Use --thismonth for the
         score of the recent month. If you add --rankes the ranks are shown
         Every result then has 5 instead of 4 entries.
       * Except for using with --test-me no profile file is needed.
       * Every score persists of 4 or 5 lines: (Rank,) Player name, short player
         name, score and commit unix timestamp. So the output will be a multiple
         of four or five lines long, e.g.
         Evil Dragon
         EVD
         1337
         1377323529
         Ziz
         ZIZ
         667
         1410088968
       fusilli info ABOUT
       * prints informations about the profile of the player
       * ABOUT may be longname, shortname, password, email, prid, cache or all.
         For "all" all informations are printed linewise in the named order.
Return values:
       *  0 if everything went fine
       * -1 (255) at submission error. This is even -1 if the submission failed,
         but was cached and if no submission was done on purpose because of
         --test-me.
       * -2 (254) if no profile file is found, but needed
