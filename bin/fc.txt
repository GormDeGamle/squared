Built for Personal Computer
Usage: fc [OPTIONS] ACTION [ACTION OPTIONS]
These actions may be:
       fc [OPTIONS] push GAMENAME SCORE [TIMEOUT]
       * submits the score SCORE for the game GAMENAME using the optional
         timeout TIMEOUT (in ms). The default timeout is 10000 ms.
       * OPTIONS may be --test-me or --cache. In the first case a score is only
         submitted if the score isn't uploaded at c4a yet for the player.
         With --cache the score is written to a file if the submit failed
         (e.g. because of a missing network connection). It will be tried
         to be resend the next time a score is submitted with fc.
       fc [OPTIONS] pull GAMENAME [TIMEOUT]
       * gets all scores of the game GAMENAME using the optional
         timeout TIMEOUT (in ms). The default timeout is 10000 ms.
       * OPTIONS may only be --test-me atm. In that case a score is only
         shown if it is from the owner of the profile.
       * Except for using with --test-me no profile file is needed.
       * Every score persists of four lines: Player name, short player name,
         score and commit unix timestamp. So the output will be a multiple of
         four lines long, e.g.
         Evil Dragon
         EVD
         1337
         1377323529
         Ziz
         ZIZ
         667
         1410088968
       fc info ABOUT
       * prints informations about the profile of the player
       * ABOUT may be longname, shortname, password, email, prid or all.
         For "all" all informations are printed linewise in the named order.
