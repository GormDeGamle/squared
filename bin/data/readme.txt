Squared! is a clone of the "2048 Number Puzzle Game"

Try to get the golden 2048 tile!
Or just try to earn as many points as possible.
Whenever two tiles with the same value meet during a move they "melt" together and are transformed to a tile with the duplicate value.
The value of the new tile is added to the score.
The game ends when there are no more possible moves.
You can exit whenever you want.
The game state is saved between calls.
